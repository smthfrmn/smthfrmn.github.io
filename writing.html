			    <span>"The phrase 'we’re just really starved for rappers who are women' is not a reflection of a dearth of women in rap (although there could always be more); rather, it is a result of mainstream entertainment media’s inability to recognize and promote groups that have historically not been recognized for their economic and creative ownership". <span class="click">Click to read.</span></span>

			    <span>"The beat then opens up into what sounds like a mixture of a woody instrument, African hand percussion, and (guessing wildly) a lap steel guitar. The bass itself is synthesized, but with a small buzz that gives it the sound of a bass African marimba that combines nicely with the high metallic sound of the rasp." <span class="click">Click to read.</span></span>

			    <span>"...its setting is surrealistic and cosmic, but its emotion is real and earthly. So too is GAWDBAWDY, with Siri’s deep and feminine voice over drum brushes, hi-hat, and chimes. The EP is a cosmic experience for sure. The cover, with Oakland’s Lake Merritt, looks lunar. And the title, GAWDBAWDY, alludes to celestial bodies of the divine." <span class="click">Click to read.</span></span>
